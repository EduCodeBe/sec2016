* people who have study the security model of a Free Software project or of an open protocol,
* hackers who played with Security and Free Software :)

Here is a non exhaustive [list of previous years speakers](https://sec2016.rmll.info/#archives).

You are (too) shy ? You do not recognize yourself into these descriptions ?

PLEASE, GO ON.

Just submit and we will exchange with you in a respectful and warmful manner :-)

### _(Hot) Topics ?_

This year, we would really like to cover :

* **privacy** free software and issues, 
* **offensive** free sotware and usages
* and **hacking** tools/software.

All usual Security topics are of course welcome : DFIR, Network, Secure Coding etc.

And, obviously, if you have a brillant and/or "strange" idea, just SUBMIT ! 

Single requirement : speaking about Free Software or Open Standard and Security :-)

### _The Format_

You can propose a talk 40min long (questions/answers included) or a workshop.

### _Travel Costs_

RMLL are a community and volunteers event with quite low budget. And this "Security Track"-only edition even more ;-)

So we try to support first the speakers with low resources such as students or coming from developing countries. We only support flight costs, not accomodation.

We ask speakers companies (if any) for taking in charge flight and accomodations costs as much as possible. 

And, of course, we try to do our best for taking in charge a majority of speakers :)

### _HOW-TO answer_ 
Just send your proposal to [cfp.sec2016@rmll.info](mailto:cfp.sec2016@rmll.info?subject=%5B2016%20RMLL%20Sec%20Track%5D%20CFP%20PROPOSAL&amp;body=%5BTalk%20Title%5D%20xxx%0A%5BTalk%20Description%5D%20xxx%0A%5BSpeaker%20Bio%5D%20xxx%0A%5BFlight%20costs%20reimbursement%5Dno/yes%20and%20estimation%0A %5BFR%20version%20if%20possible%5D%20xxx). Mail submission micro template is in the link :) 

Hope (really) to hear you soon !
Christophe, Mathieu and Philippe
