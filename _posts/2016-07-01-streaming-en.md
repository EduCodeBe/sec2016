If Murphy does not appear, you are going to be able to follow 2016 RMLL Security Track talks through a live streaming. The access will be available on the [Air Mozilla](https://air.mozilla.org) homepage.  

The individual URLs would normally be :  

* **Monday**: [https://air.mozilla.org/rmll-2016-the-security-track/](https://air.mozilla.org/rmll-2016-the-security-track/)  
* **Tuesday**: [https://air.mozilla.org/rmll-2016-the-security-track-2/](https://air.mozilla.org/rmll-2016-the-security-track-2/)  
* **Wednesday**: [https://air.mozilla.org/rmll-2016-the-security-track-4/](https://air.mozilla.org/rmll-2016-the-security-track-4/)  

Cheers :)
