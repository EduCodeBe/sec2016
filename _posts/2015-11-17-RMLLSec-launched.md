The RMLL Security Track is launched !
=====================================

Despite [no global RMLL conference will be held in 2016](http://comite.rmll.info/Les-RMLL-en-2016.html), we decided to make this year an edition of the Security Track.

It will be an opportunity to discover Paris for the first time for the RMLL Security Track ;-) And due to the unvaluable help of Mozilla, we have a beautiful room to host you and our speakers !

So, only one advice : **save the date (4 to 6 July 2016) :-)**

Christophe, Mathieu and Philippe
